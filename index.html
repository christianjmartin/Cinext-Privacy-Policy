  <h1>Cinext - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Cinext does not collect personally identifiable information. We use anonymous authentication to allow users to access features such as saving watchlists, marking films as seen, and limiting daily requests.</p>
  <p>Cinext uses the TMDB API for movie data, the Google Gemini API for AI-powered recommendations, and Supabase to manage authentication and store user preferences and films.</p>
  <p> User preferences (e.g., dark mode, seen films, watchlist choices, list inclusions) are linked to a randomly assigned, anonymous user ID. All data is securely stored and used only to provide core app functionality and basic personalization. We do not share this data with third parties or use it for advertising or analytics.</p>
  <p> We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or device identifiers.</p>
